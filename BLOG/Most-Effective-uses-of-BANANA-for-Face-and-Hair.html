                Bananas are grown through out the year. Its's one of the best ingredient to use for brightening your
                skin. Ripe Bananas
                are rich in Vitamin C and B6. It helps to improve the production of collagen in the skin that helps to
                maintain skin
                elasticity and suppleness. It also helps to get rid of wrinkle and acne. Bananas aren't only good for
                skin but hair
                too. It helps in promoting hair growth and keeps hair from drying out and getting damaged. It repairs
                damaged hair
                follicles and adds texture to it. I have included some of my fave banana mask for both hair and face.
                They are very
                effective and useful.
