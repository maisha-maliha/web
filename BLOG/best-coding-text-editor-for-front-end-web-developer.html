                Today we are gonna talk about Coding Text Editor not IDE. Text Editors and IDE are very different
                things.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a <b>Front-End Web Developer</b> finding a proper Text Editor is not so hard. You can literally
                design a complete
                website in a Windows
                Notepad. So, what does a Front-End Developer need? A Front-End Developer needs a text editor that
                is very much
                visual. A front-End Web developers Text editor should have the following qualitiesqualities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast</li>
                <li>Has Live Server</li>
                <li>Easy to edit</li>
                <li>Easy to read</li>
                <li>Has a lot of useful packages/ extensions</li>
                <li>Good Color Themes and proper colored tags</li>
                <li>Very useful sidebar( where the files are properly shown)</li>
                <li>Multiple split screen option</li>
                <li>Very useful shortcut keys(This is the king)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>
                In my opinion the Best Text Editor is <b>Visual Studio code</b>. Yes, it is undoutedly the Best
                for almost everything. It even has some IDE like funtionalities. Almost every web developers uses <b>VSCode</b>.
                It is very populor and has a very dedicated, active people working to keep it up to date. It is very
                much
                beginner friendly. VSCode is a Microsoft Product. It is COMPLETELY FREE. Although there is another
                product which is an
                IDE named <b>Visual Studio / Visual Studio IDE</b>, also made by Microsoft, which is not completely
                free. But you don't really need it (uless you need to work with something that requires an IDE)
                because the free Visual Studio Code provides everything you need as a Front-End Develoer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first Text Editor was <b>VSCode</b> and I loved it. It was very easy to get started with.
            </p>
            <h4>Color Theme:</h4>
            <p>
                Color Themes of VSCode is actually really good. The syntax coloring of VSCode is really nice and makes
                it easy to navigate your code. Infact just Click ( Ctrl + F ) and then you can search for the keyword
                you are looking for in your code. Just type the keyword in the box and click enter and you will see all
                the keywords are highlighted.
            </p>
            <h4>Split Screens</h4>
            <p>
                In VSCode you can easily work with 4 split screen running different files at a time working very
                smoothly and effectively. There is an icon in the top right coner of the screen beside the 3 dots icon. You can split
                your screen both vertically and horizontally. Just click and hold the tab/file and then move it in the
                right side of the screen if you want it in the right side and then let go. If you want o split it 
                horizontally then click and hold the tab and take in the bottom of the screen slowly and you will see
                shadows showing you how the screen will look or where it is going.
            </p>
            <h4>Extensions and Packages</h4>
            <p>
                VSCode has a lot of AMAZING Extensions that makes coding a lot more fun, easy and fast. VSCode even has
                some extension that contain features from other Text Editors like Atom , Bracket, etc. So if you use
                Atom or Bracket, it will be easy for you to transfer to VSCode. There are many extensions for code
                beautifying, shortcuts, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Live Server</h4>
            <p>
                The Live Previwing Optionality is a must as Fron-End Web Developer. While coding to design the website,
                you need to see how your website actually looks like. For that you always have to save your code and
                then refresh your website to see it. It is very much time consuming and thus Liver server is there to
                help you with viewing your code the moment you save it. It is not a built-in feature. So, in VScode you
                have to install a package named "LIVE SERVER" to get this feature.
            </p>
            <h4>Shortcuts</h4>
            <p>
                VSCode has some AMAZING shortcuts for fast coding. If you are using Atom then it will be very easy for
                you to get started with Visual Studio Code. VSCode has an extension for getting Atom keymaps and Atom
                One Dark Theme. VSCode has some built-in shortcuts that are very helpful. Once you get used to
                VSCode later it becomes hard to start with Atom or Bracket. YouYou can create a div tag with an end tag just
                by typing
                ".(name)" . This is a built-in function.
            </p>

            <h4>Color Selecting tool</h4>
            <p>
                This one is my favorite. It is very useful. When I started using atom it was very dificult to select
                color. But with Visual Studio Code I can select and edit color of any element just by hovering over the
                "color:" property value. It's kind of like Bracket but much more easier and faster.
            </p>
            <h4>File Icon</h4>
            <p>
                The built-in file icons are very beaitiful and noticeable.
            </p>
            <h4>Fast and light</h4>
            <p>
                When you are gonna work in VSCode you will feel how fast it is compared to other Text Editors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All these greate funtionalities and features make Visual Studio Code perfect for Front-End Web developments.
                Still, Everyone has their own personal likes, dislikes and preferences when it comes to coding Text Editor. So, try other text editors
                also to find which Text Editor is Best for your Front-End Web Development.
