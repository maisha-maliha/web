                It's almost 2019. Many of you are looking forward to your Freshman's year. Freshman year is not just
                the first year of
                your university but literally the start of a new phase of your life. If you look back in your life,
                more or less, you
                had certain style or look in every stage of it. So Freshman is no different and it's the most important
                time of your
                life where you have to decide a look for yourself that will live forever. Because this look will define
                you. People
                will recognize with you this look and the way you represent yourself. So if you are thinking about
                starting this new
                year with a new look or maybe thinking about entering the makeup world for the first time then you are
                in the right
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beside skincare routine, try natural or nude makeup. Makeup is a great tool to express yourself and
                represent yourself
                just the way you want to. Eye Shadow is one of them. Eye shadow is very important. You can basically
                own a few
                lipsticks and a great Eye Shadow Palette.This Eye Shadow Palette will let you create different looks by
                playing with
                the same colors. Once you put your eye shadows on, your eyes will speak for itself. Your Eye Shadows
                will define your
                mood.
