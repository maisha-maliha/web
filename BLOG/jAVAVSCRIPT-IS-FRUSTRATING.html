                When you start your jouney to becoming a Front-end web developer it all seems easy and fun and exciting. In fact it is very exciting and fun to do web design and development because you learn new things everyday and design pattern is changing every year. There is always something new to see, explore in the web design world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So you start with HTML, it's easy. You grasp all the elements and some important attributes. And when
                you start writing HTML properly and freely, You then start with CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you start styling your HTML decently and learn CSS Animation you feel like that's it girl you got this. OMG!! I wish it stayed like. Well it didn't. It was easy untill I started learning Javacsript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, Javascript doesn't have any proper syllabus like HTML and CSS. Yes, there are basic things like
                any other programming language. After learning all the basic things, you will see there are tons of
                other stuff you have to go through. The most frustrating thing is, how do you know that you don't know
                something. Like, Promises.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

                <i>
                    <a style="float:right" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises">-MDN
                    </a>
                </i>
            </blockquote> 
            
            <p>
                I don't know how many things I don't know. DOM is another thing that I just don't know where to start from. To learn Javascript you have to go through several websites and tutorials to find something new and see if you are missing out on something. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You have to practice and solve differnt algorithmic problems with basic javascript to understand how to solve problem with programming language logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding connection between a new word you discovered in javascript and web design is pretty hard. There are so many things you can start learning after learning Vanilla Javascript. But how do you know which one you need and which one is important to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Just because something is trending it doesn't mean that you need it. If you have something in mind that you want to do, then you have to do your research and see what things you have learn to be able to do that. And that is tough.
            </p>
            <p> Especially, understanding the steps you have take to reach your goal. It's hard to find a proper guide and something or someone that can show you a perfect path to your goal. If not perfect then at least an easy clean path is enough, so that you don't have to roam around and try different unnecessary things which will mess with your mind and make it hard for you so that eventually you give up.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah, Javascript is pretty Frustrating. I will soon start sharing more on Javascript and try to help you guys learn javascript in a more easier way. Hopefully, I will try to not let you guys, give up and get lost in Javascript.
