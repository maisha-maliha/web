                Loosing 100 hairs everyday day is normal but loosing more than that is something to worry about. There
                are
                many reasons
                why people start loosing hair. It can be due to aging or due to careless lifestyle. One may have male
                pattern baldness
                or female pattern baldness where men are more likely to face balding than women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the time it's us who are responsible for hair loss and sometimes it's the environment. Among
                all
                the causes of
                hair loss there 18 main reasons why we are loosing hair.
            </p>

            <h3>1.Hereditary hair loss</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes one starts loosing hair because it runs in their family. If someone's father's side or
                mother's side has hair
                loosing problem then he/she might also have it, though he/she more likely to have it because of his/her
                parents.
            </p>
            <h3>2.Aging</h3>
            <p>
                With the passage of time everything changes. The hair growth rate decreases because the follicles don't
                let
                them grow
                fast. 80% men start loosing hair or balding or hair thinning in their late 60's.
            </p>
            <p>
                Women are less likely to start balding.Their hair starts thinning after menopause and hair growth rate
                slows down
                dramatically. Though women's hair loss are less noticeable, they don't become bald completely. Beside
                these, health,
                illness and medication are also responsible for hair loss.
            </p>
            <h3>3.Male pattern baldness or female pattern baldness</h3>
            <p>
                The most common cause of hair fall is balding. According to the American Dermatology, hair loss due to
                genetics is
                known as Androgenetic alopecia. Male pattern baldness may happen in any age. One may start loosing hair
                after puberty
                or from early 20's or 30's. But mostly a man faces male pattern baldness after 40 or 50. The main
                reason of
                baldness is
                genetics or testosterone( male sex hormones). The main cause of women's pattern baldness is unknown.
            </p>
            <h3>4.Female hormone</h3>
            <p>
                Hormonal imbalances also cause hair fall. For women, the number one cause of hair fall is hormonal
                imbalances. Mainly
                due to imbalanced estrogen hormones. During pregnancy, after child birth and during menopause hormonal
                imbalances
                occur. Thus women starts loosing hair.
            </p>
            <h3>5.Too much intake of Vitamin A</h3>
            <p>
                Anything excess is never good. Vitamin A is very good for healthy hair. It repairs hair and keeps the
                scalp
                moist. Many
                hair loss treatments contain vitamin A as it is thought to stimulate hair growth. But excess vitamin A
                is
                bad for both
                hair and body. If one takes excess vitamin A then it drives the hair follicles to overdrive i.e the
                hair
                growth phase
                reaches to it's end too quickly and then starts falling. If your body is not able to produce hair that
                quickly then you
                start facing excess hair loss problems.
            </p>
            <h3>6.Lack of protein enriched food</h3>
            <p>
                Lack of Proteins will cause serious hair fall and hair damage. Because hair is produced of protein
                filament
                called
                keratin. Protein gives keratin strength and repairs it. Thus protein gives hair structure and helps to
                grow
                stronger
                and longer. That's why protein is necessary.
            </p>
            <h3>7.Stress</h3>
            <p>
                Stress leads to various physical and emotional health problems. Because stress causes hormonal
                imbalances
                and loss of
                appetite which leads to hair fall.
            </p>
            <h3>8.During Pregnancy/ After Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>
                A woman's body is filled with various hormones and chemical compounds. During pregnancy various changes
                occurs in the
                body. Many hormonal changes occurs that causes hair fall. But most of the time hair falls after the
                child
                birth.
                Because sudden weight loss after child birth puts stress on the body and hair falls a lot for a few
                months.
                But this
                type of hair fall doesn't cause balding. 3-4 months after giving birth, hair fall problem should
                diminish.
            </p>
            <h3>9.Medicine side effects</h3>
            <p>
                There care many medicines that as a side effect causes hair fall. such as, birth control pill, acne
                medication
                containing vitamin A, thyroid medication, weight loss drugs, antibiotics, anti fungal drug, cholesterol
                drug, etc
            </p>
            <h3>10.Dramatic weight loss</h3>
            <p>
                Sudden excess weight loss gives stress to one's body which makes the hair follicles to go in their
                resting
                phase which
                leads to large amount of hair fall.

            </p>
            <h3>11.Tight Braids or Pony Tails</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes we make the mistake of tying our hair too tightly which results hair damage and breakage.
                Hair
                should be tied
                loosely. It's better to not tie hair at home. As much as possible, keep it open and free.
            </p>
            <h3>12.Polluted water</h3>
            <p>
                Now a days both Air and Water are polluted. Thus if we don't protect our hair and cover it when we go
                out,
                polluted air
                will damage it. Not only that, industries are now releasing many bad chemicals in the water which are
                polluting water.
                Knowingly or unknowingly we are using it, which is also damaging our hair and causing hair fall.
            </p>
            <h3>13.Styling Hair too frequently</h3>
            <p>
                Stop heating your hair too often. Excess heat damages hair and also causes split ends. Use good hair
                products to save
                your hair from damaging. Most importantly avoid using unnecessary hair products and heat frequently.
                Love
                your natural
                hair, because it suits you the most.
            </p>
            <h3>14.Using Hair products too much</h3>
            <p>
                Use hair products as per needed. Hair products contain many chemicals that gives immediate good result
                but
                afterward
                causes great harm to hair. Hair fall and damaged hair are common scenario for those who uses too much
                hair
                products.
                Hair products contain Vitamin A which is good but excess vitamin A causes hair fall. Stop using shampoo
                too
                much or
                regularly. Try to shampoo hair 3-4 days per week. Also avoid using hair styling products all the time,
                use
                it
                occasionally.
            </p>
            <h3>15.Not buying and using Hair products carefully</h3>
            <p>
                Shampooing hair everyday causes hair thinning. It also weakens hair. Shampoos that contain silicone are
                harmful for
                hair. Avoid those shampoos. Hair dye contains chemicals that are harmful for hair. Hair dyes contain
                ammonia or
                peroxide which causes hair fall and excess use of Hair dye damages hair. So buy your products
                cautiously.
            </p>
            <h3>16.Hot water shower</h3>
            <p>
                Hot water opens both skin and hair pores. So if you take Hot water shower, don't wash your hair in hot
                water. Hair root
                becomes weak and hair comes out easily. Thus hair falls a lot.
            </p>
            <h3>17.Using small toothed Hair brush or comb</h3>
            <p>
                Small toothed combs or brushes easily pulls hair out from the root. So you should use big toothed comb
                or
                brush.
            </p>
            <h3>18.Brushing wet hair with small toothed comb or brush</h3>
            <p>
                One must never brush wet hair. Wet hair roots are weak and hair comes out easily. And on that time if
                someone brushes
                hair with small toothed comb then comes a disaster. I mean't hair falls a lot, even the strong root
                hairs.
            </p>
